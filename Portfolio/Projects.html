                <p>Webscraper built for the Northern Tornadoes Project.
                    The Twitter webscraper was built using python, twitter API v2 and the tweepy library.
                    Extracts relevant information from tweets searching by keyword. This info (the username of the tweeter, caption and tweet id) is then stored in an excel file that is created by the program and named by the user.
                    This project was created for the Team 17's ES1050 winter design project for the Northern Tornadoes Project to use to collect weather data from Twitter.
